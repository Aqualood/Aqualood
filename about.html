            Our story
        </h1>
        <p>We are an indie game company from Romania. It has originally started just for fun and ended up as an ambitious project. It is a side activity, so we can't really dedicate ourselves to it as we would have hoped, but we certanely enjoyed it so far and we hope we will continue doing it. We aim to create fun games for everyone to enjoy and we would be more than happy to recieve any feedback regarding anything about us. For now, we graduatly release the progress we've done on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLutmfxG3yLYkZVwdt_eXpg?">YouTube channel</a>, so you can go check the videos if you are interested in what we have done so far.</p>
